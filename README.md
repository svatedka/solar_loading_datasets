# Loading datasets

Much of the work is in cleaning the datasets.

The original dataset is in the folder "solar_dataset/microgrid", and corresponds to the microgrid dataset taken from [this](http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Smart/Smart) website. This must be formatted to the form in the folder microgrid_new (not very hard, but requires some thinking). 

In any case, the data available has been cleaned and is ready to use. The actual code for loading the data to a numpy array is available in the jupyter notebook in the folder "solar_dataset/code."

If you want to take a peek at large csv files (hundreds of mb, or gb), use standard text editors like emacs or Notepad++ over Excel. For smaller files, Excel is file.
